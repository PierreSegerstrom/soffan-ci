# soffan-continuous-integration

**A lightweight, webhook-driven Continuous Integration (CI) server for automated building, testing, and status reporting of GitHub repositories.**

<br>

## What this project does

This project implements a custom Continuous Integration (CI) server that automates the software development lifecycle. Upon receiving a push event from a GitHub webhook, the server securely validates the request signature, clones the specific branch of the repository, and executes an automated build and test suite using Gradle. It then provides immediate feedback by notifying the developers of the build results via the GitHub Commit Status API.

<br>


## How to use it

**Requirements**
- **Java 17** or later
- **Gradle wrapper** (included)

<br>

**Running and testing**
- **Build**: `./gradlew build`
- **Run**: `./gradlew run` or `java -jar build/libs/CI-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
- **Test**: `./gradlew test`

<br>

**Environment Variables** <br>
Create a `gradle.properties` file in the root folder:
| Variable Name      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `githubToken`      | Set this for activating ability to report back to GitHub on the commit status.
| `webhookSecret`      | We recommend to use a password-protected Webhook. If this variable is set, the CI server will verify signature of incoming requests.

<br>

> **`githubToken`**: Can be a "Fine-grained Personal Access Token" created under GitHub settings > Developer settings (at the bottom) > Personal access tokens > Fine-grained tokens. Give it Repository access > Only select repositories (for write access) and then your repo. Under permissions you need to add "Commit statuses" and change it to read and write.

## Implementation of Core CI features
The CI server is built using a modular architecture where `ContinuousIntegrationServer` acts as the orchestrator, delegating specific tasks to specialized utility classes.

### Core CI feature #1: Compilation
- **Implementation**: Upon receiving a valid GitHub `push` event, the server identifies the branch name from the JSON payload. It uses `CommandRunner.cloneOrFetchRepo` to ensure a local copy of the specific branch is present, then executes `./gradlew build -x test` to compile the project while skipping tests to isolate the compilation stage.
- **Unit Testing**: `CommandRunnerTest.java` verifies this feature by initializing a temporary Gradle project and asserting that `buildRepo` returns `true` for a valid project and `false` for an empty or invalid directory.

### Core CI feature #2: Testing
- **Implementation**: Following a successful build, the server invokes `CommandRunner.testRepo`. This method executes `./gradlew test` within the repository directory. Finally, the exit code is captured: a return value of `0` indicates all tests passed, which is then used to determine the final notification status.
- **Unit Testing**: `CommandRunnerTest.java` includes `testEmptyGradleProjectTest`, which simulates a full CI lifecycle—cloning, building, and testing—within a temporary environment to ensure the execution logic is robust.

### Core CI feature #3: Notification (Commit status)
- **Implementation**: The server provides real-time feedback via the GitHub REST API. It first sends a `pending` status when the build begins. Once the build and test stages conclude, `GitHubStatusClient` sends a POST request to GitHub's status endpoint with a state of `success` or `failure`, including a brief description of the outcome (e.g., "Build failed!" or "Tests passed!").
- **Unit Testing**: `GitHubStatusClientTest.java` ensures the URI builder correctly replaces `{sha}` placeholders in the GitHub URL template and validates that the client gracefully handles and rejects malformed URLs.
